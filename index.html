        <section id="introduction">
          <div class="introBlock hiddenElem">
            Since my childhood, I've always been fascinated by <strong>games</strong>, <strong>music</strong>, and <strong>photography</strong>, driven by an insatiable curiosity about how things work. This passion led me to dive into a <strong>Computer Science</strong> course, which I completed in 2013, where I truly began to explore my interests in technology. Then, in 2017, I earned a <strong>Master's Degree</strong> in the same field, focusing on <strong>Digital Image Processing</strong> -- an area that perfectly blends my love for visuals and tech. Recently, I also started a <strong>postgraduate program in Cloud Computing</strong>, expanding my knowledge of modern infrastructure and scalable solutions -- since it's such a hot topic these days!<br/><br/>
            
            Currently, <strong>full-stack software development</strong> has become my sweet spot, allowing me to create excellent solutions that bridge both <strong>front-end</strong> and <strong>back-end</strong> technologies. Even with a solid foundation provided by years of experience, I'm constantly on the lookout for new programming languages and frameworks to learn. I believe that growth never stops and that technology is always in constant motion.<br/><br/>
            
            Being <strong>Brazilian</strong>, I also enjoy the cultural richness that comes with my background, and I'm fluent in <strong>English</strong> while tackling <strong>French</strong> as my next challenge (<em>Oui, j'aime la France!</em>).<br/><br/> 
            
            What excites me most is connecting with others who share similar passions. If you're curious or have ideas to share, feel free to reach out -- I'm always open to <strong>collaboration</strong> and <strong>conversation</strong>!
